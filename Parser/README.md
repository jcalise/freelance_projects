Parser
===

This is a parser that I made for a friend. They were receiving a poorly formated block of JSON data that they were doing a lot of manual work on to extract a few pieces of information. 

This will take the _txt_ file that has the necessary data in it, parse it for the specific data that my friend is looking for and then dump that data into a _CSV_ file that they can use for their purposes.
